# Music-Recommendation-System
 Created a program to give music recommendations to a user based on a Spotify playlist they provided. Fetched and collected data from the API and displayed and stored the formulated data in a local database.

Please note: I created this program for my A Level NEA Project, I learnt collections and fetching and modifying data while making it so the code may not be the most efficient. I have included my NEA report as well which explains my thought process behind the code and why I chose to implement in the way I did.
