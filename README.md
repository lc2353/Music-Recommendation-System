# Music-Recommendation-System - LEGACY
A Music Recommendation System was developed as part of an A-Level NEA project, offering personalized music recommendations based on a user's Spotify playlist. The program fetches data from the Spotify API, processes it, and stores the recommendations in a local database.

The implementation involved using collections, data fetching, and data manipulation. While the code may not be fully optimized, it serves as a functional prototype demonstrating key concepts learned during the project.

As of November 2024, the [Spotify Web API has been deprecated](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api), and any plans for reoptimization have been shelved due to this change.

SQL code can be found in Music-Recommendation-System/GetPlaylistInfo/MVVM/ViewModel/FetchFromTable.cs, with the core logic in Music-Recommendation-System/GetPlaylistInfo/MVVM/ViewModel. The accompanying NEA report outlines the thought process and implementation decisions.
